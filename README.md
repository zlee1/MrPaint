Image editor inspired by Microsoft Paint for CS250: Object Oriented Programming

This was a 7-week long project with an agile, iterative development process. I received a list of requirements for the software weekly that needed to be fully implemented by the end of the week.

The editor was developed using Java and JavaFX.
